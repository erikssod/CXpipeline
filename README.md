# CXpipeline
A set of tools for analysing and collecting better CX data

## Overview
What this is and why it is.


## Requirements
What environment the different bits need.

## Installation
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
Down the line, code will be called from:
```
$ ./app.py
```
For now, put any code snippets under /src and run them directly *e.g.*:
```
cd src
./example_read_and_parse.py
```


## Output
Fancy gifs and graphs go here.
